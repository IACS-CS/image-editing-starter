/*
For your first challenge choose one of the below...

These challenges involve simple adjustments in pixel values. They are designed to get you familiar with manipulating pixel data.

1. **Brighten Filter**: Increase the brightness of an image by adding a fixed value to each color channel.
2. **Darken Filter**: Decrease the brightness of an image by subtracting a fixed value from each color channel.
3. **Noise Filter**: Add random values to pixel values to change the image.
4. **Posterize Filter**: Reduce the color complexity of the image by rounding all numbers to fixed values.
   For example, to make a poster that has only 8 colors, you would want to round each channel value to one of 2
   possible values (i.e. either round it up to 255 or down to 0).
